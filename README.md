# ClickerGame
A game idea that I came up with where a user gets points for clicking an object that teleports randomly around. I'm hoping to make it my first app on the appstore.
## To Be Added
- Highscores
- Actual Sprite (Debatable)
- Music
- Functionality to buttons on bottom
- CoreData to save highscores+points on device
- GameCenter support?
- Combos (Possibly several types)
- Things in shop
- App Icon
## Release Date
Whenever its finished and hopefully on the appstore
