# ClickerGame
A game idea that I came up with where a user gets points for clicking an object that teleports randomly around. I'm hoping to make it my first app on the appstore.
## To Be Added
- Actual Sprite (Debatable)
- GameCenter support?
- Combo Multiplayer
- App Icon
## Current Bugs
- Fastest Combo isn't calculated correctly
## Official Release Date
Whenever its finished and hopefully on the appstore.
