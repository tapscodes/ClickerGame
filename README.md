# ClickerGame
A game idea that I came up with where a user gets points for clicking an object that teleports randomly around. I'm hoping to make it my first app on the appstore.
## To Be Added
- Actual Costume Shop and Costumes  
- GameCenter support?
- (Real) App Icon
## Current Bugs
- Many Sprites Aren't Properly Sized
- Second "ClickerGame" folder with duplicated old informaton stored on github
## Official Release Date
Whenever its finished and hopefully on the appstore.
